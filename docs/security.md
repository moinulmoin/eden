# Security

This page covers what Eden does with your secrets, what is public once you
deploy, what Eden can touch in your Cloudflare account, and where the sandbox
stops protecting you. For the overall design see
[How Eden works](./how-it-works.md).

## Secrets and the env file

Runtime values such as model keys and auth secrets go in an env file you pass
with `--env-file`. Keep it outside the project and outside source control,
readable only by you:

```sh
chmod 600 ~/.config/my-agent/preview.env
```

How Eden handles it:

- **Validated before anything else.** The file must be a regular file (no
  symbolic links), UTF-8 `KEY=VALUE` records, and must not set names Eden
  reserves for the host, such as `HOST`, `PORT`, `NITRO_*`, `NODE_ENV`,
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, or Eden's own identity variables. Eden checks that
  the file does not change while the deploy runs. See the
  [reference](./reference.md) for the exact rules.
- **Never in the image.** Eden copies your project into the builder without
  your env file, without any `.env*` file, and without credential files
  (`.npmrc`, `.pnpmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.yarnrc`, `.yarnrc.yml`, `.bunfig.toml`,
  `credentials.json`, `service-account.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`). If the
  install or `eve build` output still contains one of those files, or a
  symbolic link that points outside the project, the deploy stops with
  `SECRET_EXCLUSION_FAILED`.
- **Not from your shell.** Eden runs Docker with a minimal environment
  (`PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, locale, and Docker settings) and starts the local
  boot check with a private environment, so unrelated credentials in your
  terminal do not reach the build.
- **Uploaded as Worker secrets.** Each value is uploaded with
  `wrangler secret put`, passing the value on standard input rather than as a
  command argument. Values are not written to command arguments, image
  layers, generated artifacts, or normal logs.
- **Given to the container at start.** When the Durable Object starts the
  container, it reads those secrets and passes them in as environment
  variables. Only the names from the current deploy's env file are passed, so
  use the same `--env-file` on every deploy.
- **`destroy` takes no env file.** Cleanup never needs your secrets.

## What is public

Your agent gets a public `https://<name>.<subdomain>.workers.dev` URL. Anyone
who finds it can send requests, so **your Eve authenticator is what protects
the agent.** The authenticators that `eve init` generates for Vercel and
localhost do not grant access on Cloudflare; replace the placeholder in
`agent/channels/eve.ts` with a real
[Eve authenticator](https://eve.dev/docs/guides/auth-and-route-protection)
before you deploy.

What the Worker does for you:

- Returns `404` for Eve's internal workflow queue routes
  (`/.well-known/workflow/v1/flow` and `/step`) and for `/__eden/world/*`.
  Eve's own queue deliveries reach the container through an internal path
  instead, so the public routes are never needed.
- Still forwards token-bearing `webhook/<token>` routes and `manifest.json`,
  which Eve protects itself.
- Removes headers a client could spoof: `forwarded`, `x-real-ip`,
  `true-client-ip`, `x-original-host`, `x-proxy-host` and similar, plus every
  incoming `x-forwarded-*`, `x-eden-*`, and `cf-*` header. It then sets its own
  `host`, `forwarded`, and `x-forwarded-host`/`-port`/`-proto`, so Eve sees the
  real public origin.
- Adds `x-eden-eve-*` response headers with the Worker name, public origin,
  deployment and generation IDs, and container instance name. They identify
  the deployment; they contain no secrets.

## The sandbox

Eden agents use Eve's `just-bash` sandbox: a simulated shell that runs inside
Eve's own process, not a separate Linux VM like Vercel Sandbox. Treat it as a
convenience for file and text work, not as an isolation boundary between the
agent's commands and the rest of the container.

- The sandbox and the container have unrestricted outbound internet access.
  Eve offers no setting to restrict just-bash networking
  ([eve#2927](https://github.com/vercel/eve/issues/2927)).
- Be careful with tools and skills that let untrusted users steer the agent's
  shell or network calls.

## What Eden can change in your Cloudflare account

Eden acts through your Wrangler login (`npx wrangler@4.147.0 whoami`) and
never switches accounts silently. For each target it creates one Worker, one
Container application, its Durable Objects, registry images, and, only when
your project has schedules, one Cron Trigger. The exact names are listed in
the [reference](./reference.md).

- **Exact ownership.** Eden writes a deployment record under
  `.eden/eve-deploy/` in your project. A deploy only updates a target that
  record proves Eden created; anything else fails with
  `VAL-CLI-007-TARGET-CONFLICT` instead of being overwritten.
- **Exact cleanup.** `destroy` checks the live Worker and Container
  application against that record, deletes only those and the registry
  images the records prove Eden pushed, then verifies they are gone. It never
  deletes by name prefix or by searching your account. If Eden cannot prove a
  result, it reports it as indeterminate and keeps its evidence rather than
  guessing.
- **Production is explicit.** `--env production` and `destroy` always require
  `--name`.

## What Eden changes in Eve

Nothing in your project. Inside the throwaway build container only, Eden
applies a small temporary fix to Eve's just-bash binding for
[eve#4440](https://github.com/vercel/eve/issues/4440), and only when the file
matches a checksum Eden recognizes. On any other Eve version the file is left
alone and the deploy prints an `EVE_SANDBOX_RESUME_PATCH` warning.

## The Eden packages

`@moinulmoin/eden` and its companion packages are published to npm from
GitHub Actions with npm provenance, so you can check that a release was built
from this repository:

```sh
npm view @moinulmoin/eden dist.attestations
```

## Reporting a problem

Open an issue at <https://github.com/moinulmoin/eden/issues>. Never paste
env-file values, tokens, or full `--json` output that might contain them.

Return to the [documentation index](./README.md).
